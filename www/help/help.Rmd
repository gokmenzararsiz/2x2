## Abstract

Most of the researches in the health field require 2x2 cross tables to perform categorical data analysis. To investigate the performance of diagnostic tests in determining the presence or absence of a disease, to make risk estimates in terms of variables thought to be of interest to the disease, to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship between two clinical categories, to investigate the relationship between two evaluators, to evaluate the performance of classification methods, statistical calculations can be done on these tables for solving many problems such as calculating similarity measures.

Commonly we classify study participants as follows: TP = number of people with both the disease and exposure, FP = number of people with the exposure but not the disease, FN = number of people with the disease but not the exposure, TN = number of people with neither the disease nor the exposure. Layout of a 2x2 table:

## Analysis

### 1.Table Input

When the users enter values of 'true positive (TP)', 'true negative (TN)', 'false positive (FP)' and 'false negative (FN)' and confidence interval (percentage) in cell 4 of the 2x2 table, the program automatically calculates statistical values on the right side of the screen.

### 1.File Input

Users can directly upload their datasets directly to the program instead of entering the values in cell 4 of the 2x2 table. To do this, you need to check the box "Please check if you want to use the sample dataset or enter your own data". This tool requires a dataset in `* .txt` format, which is seperated by` comma`, `semicolon`,` space` or `tab` delimiter. First row of dataset must include header. When the appropriate file is uploaded, the dataset will appear immediately on the main page of the tool (on the 'data' tab). Alternatively users can upload one of the datasets provided within the tool for testing and understanding the operating logic of the tool. 

Note: When users load their own data, they have to follow a set of rules in the .txt file with the data. In this file consisting of two columns, the first column consists of the test data and the name should be written as 'test'; the second column consists of the actual data and the name should be written as 'real_situation'. In addition, 'positive' values should be encoded as 1 and 'negative' values as 2.

## Outputs

Each row has columns 'Estimate', 'Estimate Percent' and confidence intervals for each measure. At the same time, by pressing the 'Interpretation' button, it is possible to reach a short knowledge and interpretation of the related measure.

<img src="images/resim3.jpg" alt="Outputs" align="middle" style="width:800px; height:200px;"/>

Beneath each measure group, a line graph and a box graph 'together with the confidence intervals' are given, with the dimensions of that group. These graphics can be downloaded when requested.

The metrics in each dimension group can be copied or downloaded in the desired formats.
